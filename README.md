# Credit Card Fraud Detection

In the digital age, fraud is an increasingly common and difficult problem to avoid. Legitimate cases of transactions can cover up fraud cases, making them go unnoticed among non-fraudulent cases. Furthermore, the methods used by fraudsters are constantly improved and adapted and often evolve faster than anti-fraud systems.

Credit card fraud is one of the most common types of fraud and causes problems with the credit card flags and the market. In addition, when a credit card fraud occurs, the customer is charged for a purchase they did not make.

Machine learning models are used to detect fraud and avoid financial losses. An anti-fraud system aims to identify fraudulent information with the fewest false alarms. A legitimate transaction classified as fraud is characterized as a false alarm (false positive). In the case of financial transactions, the cost of not detecting fraud can be high, but false alarms can generate dissatisfaction with legitimate customers.

Case: Credit card company needs to ensure customers are not victims of fraud. The company is also concerned about the possible classification of good customers as suspects and therefore wants to ensure that the detection system makes as few errors as possible. How can we avoid misclassifications as much as possible?
